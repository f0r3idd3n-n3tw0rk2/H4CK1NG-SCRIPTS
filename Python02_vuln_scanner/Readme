#This is a programm to get the URL and print the response of the html code back
#Then calling Beautifulsoup and giving it the response content for parsing
#Get and Print the form Content on the Page, here only one form
#Stored then in a variable


#Value for the Action and the Method is really interesting in the page for forms
#Use FindAll Method to get all the elements (action, method, input forms)
#Iterating over the list and output the contents


#Get the Action back from the response
#Get the Method back from the response
#Get the Names back of the input in forms
#Get the Type back of the input in forms
#Attribut = action and method
#HTML Element = div item input
#Inputs are part of the form
#Input List and each element is a input in the list

#Name of the Input is interesting in this case




##Action
#Build up the dictionary to submit the form
#post_data = {}
#post_data[input_name]


##Problems solved
#action method can be a full URL or a relative path
#use of urlparse library
